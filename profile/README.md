# Welcome ETHDenver!
This is a starting point to assist you in navigating the world of Janka.  We've had a lot of fun with our project and we hope you like it.  This page is a quick overview and includes info for both **Track Judges** and **Bounty Judges.**

  

## Repo Overview  
[scoring_python_apis](https://github.com/jankascore/scoring_python_apis)  
 * Repo for holding python apis for testing scoring algorithms
[typescript-scoring](https://github.com/jankascore/typescript-scoring)
 * Typescript is used to generate Janka Scores.  The same scripts are used for initial score discovery as well as the verification for attestation.
[ui](https://github.com/jankascore/ui)
 * You can find the front end code for the dApp here
 * The app is deployed in a Dockerfile and deplolyed onto a Kubernetes cluster
 * In the future this could easily be moved to a decentralized provider like Storj

It's a hackathon, but we've done our best.  Obviously we're not there with all the things but we tried to come up with an approach that could bear the burden of ETHD23.  Time will tell how well we've done, but we told the world that we are operational on [2023/03/03 at 22:07](https://twitter.com/jankascore/status/1631884099018428417)

> Back End
The heavy lifting happens with off-chain resolution (using Gelato) on both Ethereum and Base.  The dApp is a Docker contqainer self-hosted on a K8's cluster.  Plenty of opportunities to decentralize but we felt like this was a solid way to showcase what was possible at this time.

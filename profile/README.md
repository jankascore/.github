# Welcome ETHDenver!
This is a starting point to assist you in navigating the world of Janka.  We've had a lot of fun with our project and we hope you like it.

## SPONSOR & BOUNTY JUDGING 
### Coinbase - Build on Base  
Like Mac said, "We're on Base" and this can be experienced when using the app or watching our [demo video](https://youtu.be/NbEWiImrGMw).  Here is the [link to the verified smart contract](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0x586981dEB8995848C003Bca567207052A3314a14).
### Huma - Build new signal adapters  
The signal is strong and ready to be adapted, and for this bounty we are targeting the [best research paper](https://github.com/jankascore/whitepaper).
### The Graph - Best Use of Existing Subgraph(s)  
Available in the [graph_queries](https://github.com/jankascore/graph_queries) repo.
### Wallet Connect - Web3Modal DeFi Challenge: Making Bank (Without the Banks)  
There's not much that you can run and test locally, so we would suggest going stright to prod.  The app is live at [janka.mckamyk.io](https://janka.mckamyk.io/)
### Covalent - Unified API Bounties  
We are optimisic that the use case for Covalent's API's is so clear that it will be easy to award a discretionary bounty.
### BNB Chain - Transparent Bridge   
While our application focuses primarily on transparency and open verification, there is a clear need for similar patterns in privacy focused settings.  We believe the pattern of off-chain resolution is directly translatable to a privacy-focused application by swapping out the public functions for private ones.  ZK proving offers many great approaches for this.
### Circle - Build Web3 Businesses at Scale  
We are not ready to go live, we are live at [janka.mckamyk.io](https://janka.mckamyk.io/).  The API could be utilized to accept funds to be used for the honesty escrow.
### Polygon - Most Useful Web3 Tool  
The score will ultimately be calculated from MANY sources, but for now is only pulling from Aave V3 on Mainnet.  Despite the source, we are committing attestation to Goerli/Goerli Base and ideally on Polygon.
### Dfinity - Get crazy with dynamic NFTs hosted on the Internet Computer  
We did not manage to incorporate NFTs during this event. That said, including aggregate metadata within an NFT would be ideal, especially when soulbound to the wallet which attested to the score.
### Spectral Finance - Spectral.finance's Bounty  
There is value in aggregating a wide variety of established signals such as the MACRO score. This could be recorded as familiar attributes and stored in a decentralized place such as IPFS.
